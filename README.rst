aldryn-accounts
===============

Warning:: this is still work in progress.

``aldryn-accounts`` provides a packaged and opinionated app to provide:

* user signup
* login
* logout
* password change
* password reset
* adding and removing emails (with verification)
* login with external providers (gmail, github, facebook, twitter, ...)

Some assumptions:

* Login works with social logins or email. But there is no custom username.

* Emails

  * Users can have multiple email adresses. Each is verified individually.
  * Each user only has one primary email at any given time.
  * To change an email the user can add a new one, verify it and then make it his new primary email. Then he can delete the old one.
  * Users can use any of his email addresses to login (if he has defined a password)
  * Users are not forced to validate their email right away. Instead we nag them about it and provide a permission
    that can be checked to see if a user hat at least one validated email.

* Social Login

  * Users that login with an external service are not forced to have an email (TODO: bug the user to add/validate an email)
  * Multiple external services and a local password can all be assigned to the same user. Although only one account per service type is possible.


Installation
============

as package (make sure to use ``--extra-index-url http://...`` to use the internal divio package server)::

    pip install aldryn-accounts


from source for local development (*whilst in the project virtualenv*)::

    git clone git@github.com:divio/djangocms-accounts.git
    cd djangocms-accounts
    pip install -e .  # installs all the dependencies in setup.py
    python setup.py develop  # adds this source directory to the python path


Configuration
=============


In your projectâ€™s settings.py make sure you have all of:

``INSTALLED_APPS``::

    'aldryn_accounts',
    'easy_thumbnails',
    'absolute',
    'password_reset',
    'standard_form',
    'aldryn_common',

listed in INSTALLED_APPS, after 'cms'.
Then either add ``AccountsApphook`` to a page or include ``aldryn_accounts.urls``. Preferrably at ``/accounts/``.

WARN:: currently the app must be connected at ``/accounts/`` to work properly.


Run migrations.

``aldryn-accounts`` requires the django messages framework to display notifications.
see https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/contrib/messages/


WARN:: make sure you have the correct domain set in ``django.contrib.sites``. It is used for redirect urls and will
       result in ``redirect_uri_mismatch`` errors with many social auth backends.

Setup in templates
==================

The bundled templates assume the template layout of the default aldryn boilerplate.
Additionally it is required to include ``aldryn_accounts/inc/notifications.html``. These are sticky notifications
similar to those of ``django.contrib.messages``, but stay until the corresponding situation is resolved.


Extending
=========

Custom Profile
--------------

Currently the basic tabs for social auth, emails and passwords are hardcoded. But the profile navigation can be extended
using django-cms apphooks. In order for this to work, create a cms page with the page_id ``profile_navigation`` and
choose ``aldryn_accounts/profile/base.html`` as the template. To add an element to the navigation just create a
subpage and assign your view logic as an AppHook.

Overriding
----------

To override login/signup and the core profile view (and anything else really), a custom ``urls`` can be defined and
included before the builtin ``aldryn_accounts.urls``. Overriding the builtin Views with customized subclasses.

Email Sending
-------------

Email sending is handled in ``aldryn_accounts.email.EmailSender`` and can be inherited and overwritten. To make
``aldryn-accounts`` use your custom ``EmailSender`` class, specify a setting like so::

  ALDRYN_ACCOUNTS_EMAIL_SENDER = 'path.to.MyEmailSender'
